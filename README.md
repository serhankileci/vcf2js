# vcf2js

Format vCARD(.vcf) and CSV(.csv) files into an iterable format.

You can import it in the runtime:

```ts
import vcf2js from "vcf2js";

vcf2js("path/to/vcf");
```

or use the CLI to generate a JSON:

```bash
npx vcf2js path/to/vcf path/to/json
```

Work-in-progress... More information will be added.
